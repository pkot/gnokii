- 1.0 Introduction -

This is version 0.6.30 of gnokii, a multisystem tool suite and modem driver
for the mobile phones, released under the GPL.  Please see COPYING for more
details on license/copying issues, the lack of warranty and where to send a
postcard if you like gnokii :).

Primary gnokii goal was to support Nokia phones, but currently we support
all AT command compliant phones through the atgen driver. Moreover version
0.6.1 brings support for Symbian-based phones.

gnokii supports most Nokia phones from the 3110/3180, 5110/6110, 7110/6210
and 6510/6310 series, details including bugs specific to each series appear
in the files README-3810, README-6110, README-7110 and README-6510
respectively. Also all AT compatible phones are supported.

In the early stages of the project there were indications that Nokia would
provide some support for the project.  Regrettably, these negotiations
stalled over the issue of binary versus open source releases and the project
has proceeded without official or unofficial assistance.

We have a web site at http://www.gnokii.org/ and wiki at
http://wiki.gnokii.org/ which amongst other things gives information on how
to join the gnokii mailing list, retrieving bleeding edge releases through
git and more!


- 2.0 About the applications -

gnokii project provides now several suprojects and several programs in them.
The most important project provides libgnokii and core applications using
it. To get the most from gnokii it is worth understanding the details of
them and how they interact.

The first application, gnokii, is a command line utility that was originally
provided to assist developers and interested users in working with the low
level API functions that were being developed.

From these rather humble beginnings, it has evolved into a the main command
line tool of the suite.  Many people now use it for reading/writing phone
book entries, sending and receiving SMS messages etc.

The second application provided is xgnokii which as the name suggests is a X
Window System based application that provides a graphical interface to your
phone.  Amongst other things, xgnokii allows you to read and write phone
book entries, read, write and send SMS messages, monitor battery and
received signal strength.

The third part of the suite is gnokiid.  gnokiid provides a virtual modem
interface, /dev/gnokii that looks like a regular Hayes-AT compatible modem
with the ETSI defined extensions for GSM phones.  What this means in
practical terms is that you can treat the /dev/gnokii device like an
ordinary modem and use it to make data calls from pppd or a terminal
application like minicom.

Currently gnokiid is only useful for old Nokia phones from 6100 series that
didn't include AT commands support. This includes Nokia 61X0 and 51X0
models. Don't use it with other phones.

gnokiid makes use of the small helper application called mgnokiidev. It
creates on demand a symbolic link between /dev/gnokii and the pseudo tty
used by gnokiid for the virtual modem interface.  Its operation is
transparent under normal usage as gnokiid takes care of calling it when
required.

The last application within the main gnokii project is smsd, a deamon that
simplifies operation of sending and receiving SMSes to the database
operations.

There are several gnokii subprojects which are worth mentioning.

gnocky is an alternative GTK2 phone manager suite, thought as a replacement
for xgnokii, however not yet that powerful.

gnokiifs provides a filesystem access to the phone filesystem (if the phone
supports it) on top of libgnokii. You may need this just when the phone
doesn't support Obex protocol.

gnapplet is a phone driver for the Symbian phones. This is at the moment the
only way we can access various data on such phones as AT capabilites of
Symbians are very limites (you can access them also with SyncML getting some
more information).

gnokii-artwork contains some images and pixmaps that may be used by xgnokii
and other GUIs. They are put into the separate module because we are not
sure about the licensing.

gnokii-extras contains sample applications (some of them really useful!)
demonstrating how to use libgnokii.

There are also several third-party applications using libgnokii, including:
kdepim (distributed within KDE), Multisync and Opensync (as a plugin), GNOME
PhoneManager, Maemo's PhoneLink, qnokii.


- 3.0  Notes for specific model phones -

Please see the README-3810 file for notes specific to the 3810/8110 series,
README-6110 for notes on the 5110/6110 series, README-2110 for notes on the
2110 series (which is at the moment deprecated), README-7110 for notes on
7110/6210 series and README-6510 for notes on the 6510/6310 series.

If you have DKU2 cable, read README-DKU2 to see how to get support under
Linux (other OSes are not supported yet).

See also README-dancall, README-ericsson, README-siemens and README-Symbian
for notes on these phones.

For building WIN32 versions see README-WIN32 file.


- 4.0 Installation from source -

gnokii makes use of autoconf/automake which allows you to configure the
source tree for your system by typing

./configure

You can also run the script with the --help flag to get a list of available
options.  There are about a dozen or so that are specific to gnokii.

Once you've run ./configure successfully, you should be able to simply do a
make and make install to compile and install your binaries respectively.

make

make install

With this done you've built and installed your binaries, and should proceed
to the configuration section below.


- 5.0 Installation of pre-built binaries -

Primary choose should be to install what your distribution (or in general:
system) provides. gnokii is present in most of the popular Linux
distributions as well as in FreeBSD ports. To install gnokii use the way
your distribution recommends (apt-get, yum, synaptic, emerge, ...)

However, if you would like to use more up-to-date gnokii versions (ie. git
versions) and don't want to compile it by hand, there are several unofficial
repositories hosting gnokii packages. There is a list of such repositories
at http://wiki.gnokii.org/index.php/PreBuiltPackages.


- 6.0 Configuration -

Once you have installed the binaries, you should take the sample/gnokiirc
file from the Docs directory. As of 0.7.0 version gnokii follows
freedesktop.org specifications and looks for the config file in
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnokii/config. Verify the setting in your system (usually
it should be $HOME/.config) and place there your config file.
Using your favorite editor ensure that the settings are correct for your
system, the sample file has details of the various options available. You
may refer to <http://wiki.gnokii.org/index.php/Config> for the
configurations known to work. You may use gnokii-configure utility for
assistance. It is provided in utils dir in gnokii distribution.

If you used a pre-built version of gnokii (.rpm, .deb etc) it may have
installed a /etc/xdg/gnokii/config or /etc/gnokiirc file.  If it has, the
settings in this file will be used in the absence of a config file in
your home directory.

Note that you will need read/write permissions on whatever device you
specify in config file.  You can now use gnokii and xgnokii.

Review the notes specific to your model of phone in the appropriate README
file. These files also provide information about what functionality is
available for each model. Sample config file provided with gnokii sources
provides many examples and explanations.

In order to make use of the AT emulator provided by gnokiid through
/dev/gnokii, you must read the documentation file DataCalls-QuickStart.

A simple test to confirm that your cable/IrDA/bluetooth link is working is
to run gnokii with the --identify flag e.g.

  foobar$ gnokii --identify

This will attempt to connect to your phone and display the basic information
about the phone: manufacturer, phone model, firmware version and IMEI.

If you get an error along the lines of
	
  Telephone interface init failed: [...]. Quitting.

this indicates that gnokii could not communicate with your phone for some
reason and you will need to do some troubleshooting.

As the other test you may try:

  foobar$ gnokii --monitor

which should show you some other information like memory usage or signal
strength.


- 7.0 Known Bugs -

Review the bugs section in the README for your series of phone.


- 8.0 libgnokii bindings -

- 8.1 Perl -

There is a perlmodule available for gnokii. It gives access to some of the
public libgnokii routines from a perl-program. It is intended for
application developers who want to use their favorite language in
interfacing the phone data with databases, ldap-directories and (in the
future) different calendar applications. It is written by Konstantin Agouros
(konstantin@agouros.de) and support starts with revision 0.2.6-pre3 of
gnokii.

The homepage of this module is http://www.agouros.de/gnokii

Please note that Perl binding has not been updated for some time and may not
work with current libgnokii.

- 8.2 PHP -

Daniele Forsi prepared PHP bindings for libgnokii. It should be mostly
up-to-date and supports most of the useful things that you might use from a
webpage.

You can find more information about gnokiiphp at
http://www.forsi.it/taxonomy/term/21%252C6.


- 9.0 How to help -

There are a number of ways you can help out.

Code specific to each model is contained within common/phones/*.c and
include/phones/*.h files. All command handlers will dump information to
stderr when they encounter a message they don't understand.  If this happens
to you, try and work out what is going on. When gnokii receives the frame
with the unknown meaning it stores the frame and the triggering frame to
$HOME/.gnokii-errors file. Report it!

Suggestions on changes to the code are welcome, the preference is that they
be aired on the mailing list so that a consensus can be reached when
appropriate.  This is particularly important if you intend making large
changes and/or submitting big patches.


- 10.0 gnokii by git -

The source of gnokii applications is in the git server.  If you are already
familiar with git, clone the main repository (containing libgnokii, gnokii,
xgnokii and smsd) with:

	git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gnokii.git

and, optionally, the other repositories with:

	git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gnokii/gnapplet.git		# Applet for Symbian phones
	git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gnokii/gnocky.git		# Alternate GUI
	git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gnokii/gnokii-artwork.git	# Optional graphic files
	git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gnokii/gnokii-extras.git	# Additional programs and language bindings
	git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gnokii/gnokiifs.git		# CODA file system
	git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gnokii/knokiisync.git		# KDE Address Book synchronization
	git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gnokii/zphone.git		# Zaurus frontend

If you are not familiar with git, don't worry. It's very simple. Just
install the git package for your distribution and follow these steps:

	1. Open your favorite shell, cd to the directory that will
	   contain the gnokii directory and execute this command:

	   git clone --depth 1 git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/gnokii.git

	   this creates a 'gnokii' directory in which the sources and
	   other needed files are downloaded; the --depth 1 argument
	   creates a shallow clone which is slightly smaller and
	   quicker to download (it is adequate for compiling but has
	   some limitations, omit it if you want the full history, see
	   man git-clone for details).

	   In future you can update to the latest sources running the
	   following command from inside the 'gnokii' directory:

	   git pull

	2. There are other programs available in the gnokii repository
	   that you can get in a similar way (see above for addresses)
	   each in a different directory, NOT inside 'gnokii'

If you prefer, there is a WWW interface to the git server at

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gnokii.git/

Once you have the sources, you will need to run the following commands

	libtoolize -c -f
	glib-gettextize -f
	# under FreeBSD you may want to provide additional parameter to
	# aclocal: -I /usr/local/share/aclocal
	aclocal -I m4
	autoheader -I m4
	automake --add-missing
	autoconf
	./configure
	make

or just issue

	sh autogen.sh
	make

to build the sources.

Now you are on your own - you have the current sources on your disk in the
directory gnokii.  If you are going to make substantial changes and feel
that they should be included into gnokii please mention it on the list first
to avoid duplicated effort.

If you would like to receive email when updates are made to the git
repository, subscribe to gnokii-commit mailing list at
http://mail.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnokii-commit.

Our thanks go to the Czech Linux Users Group for hosting the original CVS
repository at cvs.linux.cz and then to the Samba Team who kept hosting our
CVS for the several years at cvs.samba.org.

Interim release to bring released code into line with latest CVS offerings.

19990824 Version 0.3.0
6110 functionality has increased again, details of which are in the 6110
specific readme.  Few minor tweaks on the 3810 side but we've just about run
out of things the 3810 can do (data and fax calls aside of course!)

This release is the first to include xgnokii - an X based interface to your
phone and gnokiid - the makings of a virtual modem/AT emulator interface.
Details of these two apps appear above.

19990519 Version 0.2.5
Little has changed on the 3810 side - mostly adding stub functions to stay
current with the 6110 code.  A no-brainer bug was found in the SMS send
routines which is now corrected - could have caused multiple messages to be
sent.

6110 support has moved ahead in leaps and bounds, SMS sending is now in
there along with many other new function.

19990328 Version 0.2.4
Largely a synchronisation release to incorporate Pavel's numerous patches
for 6110 support and internationalisation (such a long word, i18n is better
:-).

Added SMS delete function for 3810 series.

19990305 Version 0.2.3
Added gsm-api.c/.h and gsm-common.h as a standard interface and set of
datatypes that can be used across multiple models.  This API is still a work
in progress.

Changed references to "handset" to "phone" to ensure a consistent
nomenclature.

Phonebook is now dumped with words int or sim for memory type rather than a
numeric value.

19990219 Version 0.2.2
Fixed bug and added support to display bytes returned when the link is
initialised.  If you see something other than the values noted in fbus.c,
please let me know and include your phone type and software version.

Added initial cut of SMS send capability.  Caveats are discussed above.

Added two different default values for length of phonebook name and numbers.
These are selected according to whether internal or SIM memory is specified.

Fixed bugs reported in 0.2.1 (errno.h and reversal of message center and
sender fields)

19990216 Version 0.2.1
Fixed bug that caused phone book entries containing spaces to be mangled.
Added retrieve SMS message function.

19990213 Version 0.2.0
First version that looks more like the finished product - supports command
line options etc.

19990126 Version 0.1.0
Initial release of monitoring tool - first rough incarnation of gnokii -
what will ultimately be the monitoring and programming tool.
