.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
.B gnokii
is a multiple systems tool suite and (eventually) modem/fax driver for the mobile phones.
.PP 
.B gnokii 
at the beginning was designed to support Nokia phones. At the moment it supports most of the Nokia mobiles including 6100 series (models like 6110 or 5110), 7110 series (models like 7110 or 6210) and 6510 series (models like 6310 or 6510). The most recent models as Nokia 7650 are not yet fully supported but we're working on it. At the moment it also supports also the phones that are capable to understand AT commands. Tested AT phones are: Nokia 7110/6210/6250/6310(i)/6510/8210/9210/7650/3650, Siemens S25/SL45i/C55/M55/S55, Ericsson T39, SonyEricsson T68i, Bosch 908/909 and Motorola Timeport P7389i and C350.

gets SMS messages from specified \fImemory type\fR starting at entry \fIstart\fR and ending at \fIend\fR.
For the \fImemory types\fR you usually use SM for the SIM card and ME for the phone memory. The exception are the phones supported by nk7110 (Nokia 7110/6210/6250) and nk6510 (Nokia 6310/6510/8310) drivers. For these you should use IN for the Inbox, OU for the Outbox, AR for the Archive, TE for the Templates and F1, F2, ... for your own folders.
If \fIend\fR is not specified only one location \- \fIstart\fR is read.
If \-f \fIfile\fR is used entries are saved in \fIfile\fR. If the file already existis, user is prompted whether to overwrite the file. \-F option forces gnokii to overwrite the file without asking. If none of these switches is used entries are dumped to stdout.
If \-d switch is used, a message is deleted after reading.

You can use also \fI\-r\fR or \fI\-\-raw\fR switch to get the raw output.
You can use it then with \fI\-\-writephonebook\fR. Normally you got verbose output.
.TP 
.BR "\-\-writephonebook [\-o|\-\-overwrite] [\-f|\-\-find\-free]"
reads data from stdin and writes to phonebook.
When \-i option is used, refuses to overwrite existing entries.
Uses the same format as provided by the output of the getphonebook command.
See below for details.
.PP
When the \-o or \-\-overwrite option is used, existing entries at a given
location are overwritten.
.PP
When the \-f or \-\-find\-free option is given,
.B gnokii
tries to find a free location.  In this case, you can omit the location field
in the input data.
.PP
The phonebook format is very simple.  Each line represents one entry.  Fields
are separated by semicolons.  Semicolons aren't allowed inside a field.  The
fields have to be in this order (the subentries are optional, ie. you can
repeat all subetry field multiple times, but they have to be alltogether in
the given order):
.IP "" .5i
