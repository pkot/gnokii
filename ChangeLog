      instead of true                               (Daniele Forsi)
    o exit when given phone model is not in 5110, 5130, 6110,

    o handle GN_ERR_INVALIDLOCATION and GN_ERR_INVALIDMEMORYTYPE

    o change the error message in install_log_handler() to print
      the name of the logfile that failed to open to easily detect
      typos when changing the HOME variable in multiple phones
      setups; also start NLS stuff before calling
      install_log_handler() so this error message is translated
                                                    (Daniele Forsi)

    o use old call API with Nokia 3210 NSE-8 (tested with firmwares

    o handle 'prev_state' with code 0x01 as GN_CALL_Idle (seen on
      Nokia 3330) else IncomingCallInfo() would fail with
      GN_ERR_UNHANDLEDFRAME                         (Daniele Forsi)
    o use old call API with Nokia 3310 (tested with firmware 5.79)

    o discourage gnokiid for real modems                (Paweł Kot)
    o fix usage string for --writephonebook as both --memory-type
      and --memory-location need a parameter and an alternate form
      of --memory-location is --location; fix usage strings in some
      of the new split gnokii files; update usage string in gnokiid
                                                    (Daniele Forsi)

 * xgnokii updates
    o remove ExposeDisplay() from xgnokii/xgnokii_netmon.c as it's
      no more needed and was causing an infinite loop with a crash

    o enable Netmonitor menu for 3210|3310|3330     (Daniele Forsi)
    o use gtk_window_present() instead of gtk_widget_show() when
      user clicks the menus so windows are always shown; gtk docs
      say: "This may mean raising the window in the stacking order,
      deiconifying it, moving it to the current desktop, and/or
      giving it the keyboard focus, possibly dependent on the
      user's platform, window manager, and preferences."
                                                    (Daniele Forsi)
    o in Logos window provide an empty network code when it could
      not be read from the phone else later code would reference
      unitialized memory (it is possible to read startup logo and
      operator logo from a Nokia 3330 even when SIM card is missing
      or PIN code is required)                      (Daniele Forsi)

    o don't segfault in Speed Dial window trying to associate a
      speed dial to a phone number when the phonebook could not be

                                                    (Daniele Forsi)
    o make Speed Dial window a little wider to avoid the horizontal

    o fix memory leaks				     (Helge Deller)
    o add .cvsignore files                           (Helge Deller)
    o avoid double free on lockfile unlock              (Paweł Kot)
    o make pnok_call_divert_incoming() allocate the needed struct
      when it is missing (e.g. when receiving unsolicited messages)
                                                    (Daniele Forsi)
    o add timegm() function for the systems that do not have it
                                                        (Paweł Kot)

    o add support for connection=dku5 setting           (Paweł Kot)
    o avoid using sprintf(buf, "%s...", buf, ...) as it doesn't
      work on some systems                              (Paweł Kot)
