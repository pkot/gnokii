                 - Known bug list for gnokii. -

19990217 08:38  Version 0.2.1

* Sender and Message Centre fields are reversed when dumping
  SMS messages.  Thus the Sender is shown as Message Centre
  and Message Centre as Sender.

* Rather than adding a hardcoded reference to
  "/usr/include/asm/errno.h" you should add #include <errno.h>
  to fbus.c.

19990216 22:34  Version 0.2.1

* Phonebook writes still occassionally fail.  Weird.

19990216 00:09  Version 0.2.0

* Bug in parsing of the input file when writing phone book entries
  will cause entries with spaces to be messed up.  Either
  replace spaces with another character or wait for 0.2.1 which
  fixes this.  [0.2.1 Due next day or so]

* You may need to include errno.h in fbus.c if you're getting
  errors building the code. 
  (Add #include "/usr/include/asm/errno.h")

Thanks to Tony Lindstrom for pointing these two out.
